Life is a long game, and the true winners are the ones who endure the long run slowly and steadily. So stop. Breathe. Look around, and appreciate the small things that bring you guaranteed happiness. Read a book, stay out in the sun, stretch once in a while. </p>

		<p class="text">If you feel like you have lost purpose or direction in life like a hamster stuck in an endless wheel with no other option than to continue running, running, running, then have the courage to jump off from the cycle for a while and take a break. This isn't you giving up or feeling week, but knowing what's best for you and preparing yourself for what will come next. Grab a cup of tea and sit down at a cafe. 
            Do some people-watching or just stare at the outside scenery, wherever it may be. Appreciate yourself, because only you can do that for yourself.
